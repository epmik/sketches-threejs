THREEjs

uses a right handed coordinate system
    - positive x moves right
    - positive y moves up
    - positive z moves back, negative z moves forward into the screen, 

front faces have a counter-clockwise winding order

GL.TriangleStrip and GL.TriangleFan aren't supported anymore (since version 112)
